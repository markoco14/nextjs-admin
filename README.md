## Introduction

I built this project to showcase knowledge of Next.js and Mirage. I created an admin section for online clothing retailer.

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to show how to mock API requests with Mirage.js, and create an interactive CRUD experience for users to test the result. Going deeper, I will implement Mirage functionality like serializers to let me make mock sales data for each of the products. 

## Run the project

```
git clone https://github.com/markoco14/nextjs-admin.git

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Project Goals

My goals are to:

1. Create the app using Next.j
2. Make the experience interactive by mocking data with Mirage
    - Mock product data
    - Display products in "Catalogue" to see the Customer view
    - Use Serializers to make mock sales data for each product
    - Display the sales data in a table using AgGrid
3. Complete the experience with Authentication using Next-Auth
